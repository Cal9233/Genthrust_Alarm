Because your script currently relies on your laptop being turned on and connected to the internet, "running all the time" implies one of two things:

The "Background" Method: You run it on your laptop (or an office server) silently in the background, ensuring it auto-starts if the computer restarts.

The "Cloud" Method: You upload it to Azure/Cloud, so it runs on Microsoft's servers 24/7 (even if your laptop is off).

Given you are already in Azure, I will show you how to make the script Crash-Proof first, then how to run it in the background on Windows.

Step 1: Make the Bot "Crash-Proof"
Currently, if the internet blinks or the bot hits a weird error, the script will crash and stop running. We need to change the loop so it automatically restarts if it encounters an error.

Update the very bottom of src/app.py (replace the if __name__ == "__main__": block):

Test it: Double-click this file. It should open a black window and start the bot. If that works, close it and proceed.

B. Set up Task Scheduler
Press Win + R, type taskschd.msc, and hit Enter.

On the right, click Create Basic Task.

Name: InventoryBot. Click Next.

Trigger: Select When the computer starts (or "When I log on"). Click Next.

Action: Start a program. Click Next.

Program/script: Browse and select your start_bot.bat file.

Start in (Optional): Paste the folder path: C:\Users\calvi\Projects\Genthrust_Alarm\

Click Finish.

C. Make it Hidden (Optional)
If you don't want the black window popping up:

Find InventoryBot in the list (middle pane).

Right-click > Properties.

Select Run whether user is logged on or not.

Check Hidden.

Click OK (It might ask for your Windows password).

Now, even if you restart your computer, the bot will silently start working in the background.

Step 3: The "Cloud" Method (Azure Web App)
Since you are an Admin and already have the Azure App Registration, the most professional way is to host this on an Azure Web App.

Why?

It never sleeps (Runs 24/7).

It doesn't use your laptop's battery/resources.

It auto-restarts if Microsoft updates servers.

How to do it:

Go to Azure Portal > App Services > Create.

Name: Genthrust-Inventory-Bot.

Publish: Code.

Runtime: Python 3.10 (or 3.11).

Region: East US (or close to you).

Plan: You can start with Free (F1) or Basic (B1).

Once created, go to Deployment Center and connect your GitHub Repository.

CRITICAL: Go to Configuration (Settings) in the left menu. You MUST manually add every variable from your .env file (AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET, etc.) as "Application Settings" here, because .env files are not uploaded to the cloud for security.

This method requires a bit more setup but is the "forever" solution. For now, Task Scheduler (Step 2) will likely work perfectly for your needs.
